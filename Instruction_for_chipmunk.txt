Script to run the test
# Run domino

# Run Chipmunk with Banzai's ALU
1. go to chipmunk_experiments-tofino folder
```
cd ~/chipmunk_experiments-tofino
python3 run_expr_simple.py
```

# Run Chipmunk with Tofino's ALU
Because the user need to run one benchmark and verify one benchmark
1. go to chipmunk_experiments-tofino folder (Take conga.c as an example)
```
cd ~/chipmunk_experiments-tofino
python3 compile_with_tofino.py ../domino-examples/domino_programs/sampling.c 1 3 3 10 2
```
