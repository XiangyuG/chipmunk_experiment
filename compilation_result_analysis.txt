conga                             Fail            Because there is %(mod) in program. I think we can try with some modification

dns_ttl_change                    Fail            Previously, we have not tried because of if_else condition is not supported

hull                              Fail            I am trying to run this now because I think this is most likely to 
                                                  get successful compilation but we need to provide enough grid size

many_ip_domains                   Fail            The # of stages and # of phv per stage are too big to try

snap_heavy_hitter                 Fail            Previously, we have not tried because of if_else condition is not supported
                                                  in stateless alu. I think this can be the 3rd program to try compilation

                                                  in stateless alu. I think this can be the 2nd program to try run compilation
